📈  I'm revamping data infrastructure to support analytics for the PMs / Engineers leading Google's Advertising Platform. We use assets I own to inform engineering decisions, track goals, create effective narratives for the business, and align teams to make strategy easy.

📊  I enjoy architecting data and democratizing access to advanced knowledge. I have high integrity for the truth and love to put attention to details.

🗝  I hope to figure out how innovative technologies can be applied at scale and what that means for us as a society, then harness that information for good. I'm humbled and motivated by important problems to solve, I try to learn broadly to try and understand what to keep my attention on.

🌎  I'm interested in data engineering and analytics, technology, economics, a variety of sciences, philosophy, and things that are relevant. In my free time, I am often playing acoustic guitar (playlist aficionado too), reading, listening to podcasts, hiking and enjoying nature.
